Sudoku Solver
=============

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: [https://sudoku-solver.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://sudoku-solver.freecodecamp.rocks/). Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

*   Clone [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/freecodecamp/boilerplate-project-sudoku-solver) and complete your project locally.
*   Use [our Gitpod starter project](https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/freecodecamp/boilerplate-project-sudoku-solver) to complete your project. Learn [how to share your Gitpod workspace to get help](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-use-gitpod-in-the-curriculum/668669#how-can-i-share-my-workspace-to-get-help-8).
*   Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

* * *

*   All puzzle logic can go into `/controllers/sudoku-solver.js`
    *   The `validate` function should take a given puzzle string and check it to see if it has 81 valid characters for the input.
    *   The `check` functions should be validating against the _current_ state of the board.
    *   The `solve` function should handle solving any given valid puzzle string, not just the test inputs and solutions. You are expected to write out the logic to solve this.
*   All routing logic can go into `/routes/api.js`
*   See the `puzzle-strings.js` file in `/controllers` for some sample puzzles your application should solve
*   To run the challenge tests on this page, set `NODE_ENV` to `test` without quotes in the `.env` file
*   To run the tests in the console, use the command `npm run test`.

Write the following tests in `tests/1_unit-tests.js`:

*   Logic handles a valid puzzle string of 81 characters
*   Logic handles a puzzle string with invalid characters (not 1-9 or `.`)
*   Logic handles a puzzle string that is not 81 characters in length
*   Logic handles a valid row placement
*   Logic handles an invalid row placement
*   Logic handles a valid column placement
*   Logic handles an invalid column placement
*   Logic handles a valid region (3x3 grid) placement
*   Logic handles an invalid region (3x3 grid) placement
*   Valid puzzle strings pass the solver
*   Invalid puzzle strings fail the solver
*   Solver returns the expected solution for an incomplete puzzle

Write the following tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`

*   Solve a puzzle with valid puzzle string: POST request to `/api/solve`
*   Solve a puzzle with missing puzzle string: POST request to `/api/solve`
*   Solve a puzzle with invalid characters: POST request to `/api/solve`
*   Solve a puzzle with incorrect length: POST request to `/api/solve`
*   Solve a puzzle that cannot be solved: POST request to `/api/solve`
*   Check a puzzle placement with all fields: POST request to `/api/check`
*   Check a puzzle placement with single placement conflict: POST request to `/api/check`
*   Check a puzzle placement with multiple placement conflicts: POST request to `/api/check`
*   Check a puzzle placement with all placement conflicts: POST request to `/api/check`
*   Check a puzzle placement with missing required fields: POST request to `/api/check`
*   Check a puzzle placement with invalid characters: POST request to `/api/check`
*   Check a puzzle placement with incorrect length: POST request to `/api/check`
*   Check a puzzle placement with invalid placement coordinate: POST request to `/api/check`
*   Check a puzzle placement with invalid placement value: POST request to `/api/check`

Tests
-----

1\. You should provide your own project, not the example URL.

2\. You can `POST` `/api/solve` with form data containing `puzzle` which will be a string containing a combination of numbers (1-9) and periods `.` to represent empty spaces. The returned object will contain a `solution` property with the solved puzzle.

3\. If the object submitted to `/api/solve` is missing `puzzle`, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Required field missing' }`

4\. If the puzzle submitted to `/api/solve` contains values which are not numbers or periods, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Invalid characters in puzzle' }`

5\. If the puzzle submitted to `/api/solve` is greater or less than 81 characters, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Expected puzzle to be 81 characters long' }`

6\. If the puzzle submitted to `/api/solve` is invalid or cannot be solved, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Puzzle cannot be solved' }`

7\. You can `POST` to `/api/check` an object containing `puzzle`, `coordinate`, and `value` where the `coordinate` is the letter A-I indicating the row, followed by a number 1-9 indicating the column, and `value` is a number from 1-9.

8\. The return value from the `POST` to `/api/check` will be an object containing a `valid` property, which is `true` if the number may be placed at the provided coordinate and `false` if the number may not. If false, the returned object will also contain a `conflict` property which is an array containing the strings `"row"`, `"column"`, and/or `"region"` depending on which makes the placement invalid.

9\. If `value` submitted to `/api/check` is already placed in `puzzle` on that `coordinate`, the returned value will be an object containing a `valid` property with `true` if `value` is not conflicting.

10\. If the puzzle submitted to `/api/check` contains values which are not numbers or periods, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Invalid characters in puzzle' }`

11\. If the puzzle submitted to `/api/check` is greater or less than 81 characters, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Expected puzzle to be 81 characters long' }`

12\. If the object submitted to `/api/check` is missing `puzzle`, `coordinate` or `value`, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Required field(s) missing' }`

13\. If the coordinate submitted to `api/check` does not point to an existing grid cell, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Invalid coordinate'}`

14\. If the `value` submitted to `/api/check` is not a number between 1 and 9, the returned value will be `{ error: 'Invalid value' }`

15\. All 12 unit tests are complete and passing.

16\. All 14 functional tests are complete and passing.
